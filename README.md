React E-Commerce Web Application

This project is the Front-End part of an E-Commerce cloth store website using ReactJS.
I have used styled-components and material-ui libraries to add component-level style to every part of the web application.
Basically, this front-end web application consists of six pages namely:
•	Home
•	Register
•	Login
•	Cart
•	Product
•	ProductList
Now let's dive into each page. Before getting into each page, let us first understand the components of every page.
There are several components on every page. Out of which the common ones are:
•	Navbar
•	Announcement
•	Newsletter
•	Slider
•	Footer
and also there are several other components like Product, Products, Categories, and CategoryItem.
Then getting into each page one by one:
Home Page
Link to the page: HomePage
 
Register Page
 
Login Page
 
 
Product Page
 
ProductList Page
 
 
Cart Page
